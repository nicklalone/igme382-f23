3. What is Active remote sensing?

Active Remote Sensing is when a remote sensor uses its own method of energy/radiation to help map out and analyze regions.

5. What is Passive remote sensing?
“Passive sensors detect energy emitted or reflected from an object, and include different types of radiometers and spectrometers. Most passive systems used in remote sensing applications operate in the visible, infrared, thermal infrared, and microwave portions of the electromagnetic spectrum.”

7. What kind of data does remote sensing include?
* [https://youtu.be/vzfGMMEEz5w?si=oWCvm4YWbhrHtPY8](https://youtu.be/vzfGMMEEz5w?si=oWCvm4YWbhrHtPY8)Spectral data collected from satellites, aircraft, and handheld sensors
    

* Radar, sonar, lidar, and echo-sounder methods collect reflected wavelengths that are usually displayed in % reflectance in relation to micrometers (µm)

* The bands of wavelengths collected depend on the collection method, but usually include shorter wavelength Ultra-Violet (UV) to longer wavelength Near InfraRed (NIR) and Thermal InfraRed (TIR)

Other forms of collected data come from photography, push broom sensors (device for obtaining images with [spectroscopic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum) sensors), and scanning mirrors

8. In what circumstances are feet a remote sensor?
 In an earthquake, when the floor is wet, detecting temperature changes, finding where the floor is(uneven surface)

9. If I were to design a remote sensor for some phenomenon, what would that thing be tasked at sensing?

Stand name: Wayward Sons
Appearance: a series of satellites that orbit the user
Stand abilities: remote sensing
Wayward sons use remote sensing to determine the exact distance anything is from the user
Fish finder from space. Who needs the NASA budget anyway. 

10. Why is it needed?
* To find out where things are without actually going there 
* Measure/detect over very large surface areas, where manually recording would be impossible.
 * It provides a global perspective on current natural events happening around the world
* Surveying large swaths of natural resources at once, monitoring dynamic changes of desertification, flood, drought, and landforms from a distance (satellite images). Veress, Benjamin, and Jozsi Szigethy, editors. Horizons in Earth Science Research. Volume 24. Nova Science Publishers, [2023].
* It provides a consistent source of data over time allowing for long term monitoring and analysis
* Cost efficiency through automating data collection
