### 2 — Elevating Session 0 — Let’s Talk About Dungeons

#### Or why is it we love putting our imaginary friends in Danger?

[In post 0, I discussed the issue of bringing people into tabletop RPGs by comparing it to a syllabus day in college.](https://medium.com/@nick-lalone/0-elevating-session-0-past-an-explanation-of-the-syllabus-5f7c0c990f15) Folks come, judge you, don’t read the syllabus, and then leave. Maybe they’ll come back, maybe they won’t. 

[In post 1, I discussed the so-called “missing masses” of tabletop RPGs (ttrpgs).](https://medium.com/@nick-lalone/1-elevating-session-0-the-game-of-dungeons-fe2f0ad0459c) To me, they are missing a potential issue wherein folks want to treat them like computer games but miss that they are essentially communal storytelling moments. Leaning in to that commune could potentially provide a way through which to enhance player retention, player comfort, and player agency by essentially allowing the table craft the world. These are the missing masses.

In this post, I want to take things a step further. Most games will provide a “hook” to excite the players and this hook is typically some sort of mini-dungeon or full blown dungeon wherein players will learn how a game works, how a world works, who their character is, and how to deal with it all. What if session 0 itself was the hook, the reason to be in the world…not a reason to go into a Dungeon?

So this post is focusing on “hooks” or to be direct, the word, “Dungeons” in _Dungeons and Dragons (D&D)_ and alternative ways to bring players into the world.

When _D&D_ was released, folks immediately understood its potential. Through D&D, games like _pedit5_ and _dnd_ written for PLATO with the language TUTOR contained the trappings of what would become _roguelikes_ a good 7 or 8 years later, they’d bring us bosses of Dungeons, treasures, and quickly, the whole realm of _Dungeons_ and designing dungeons would become an art form.

In fact, we saw endless zine articles, newsletters, and supplements devoted to the cause.

In D&D in general, the place of the DM is to come up with literally everything. So, supplements like this present suggestions on adventure design. 

The above says in Book 1: 

> “We all come up with adventure ideas in different ways. Some DMs first have an idea of a spectacular, blood-and-thunder climax, and then put together an adventure which will get the characters up to that point. Others first come up with a master villain or hideous monster, and then come up with the adventure elements it will take to bring their heroes into conflict with that enemy. Still others decide ona. theme first — for instance, bringing the heroes into conflict with nature, with a specific villain, with society’s injustices, and so on.”

So from first edition, we see a normalization of form. This is what and how a game of _D&D_ works.

10 years later, we would see the, “Dungeon Builder’s Guidebook.” Different author, different edition of D&D and so, what did this book have to say about how to build a dungeon? It’s interesting. Gone is the tricky synonyms of “adventure” and “dungeon” as the time between 1st edition and 2nd edition saw TSR, the then makers of D&D, start to lower their target age for the game in an effort to expand its marketshare. Next, they also began to pre-package worlds like _Dragonlance, Ravenloft, Forgotten Realms,_ and even _Spelljammer_.

In the space of 10 years, we began to see some fidelity added to game worlds. This was mostly due in part to things like worldbuilding becoming more prevalent and dungeons invading literally everything. Dungeon came to mean something akin to, “tension” or some sort of driving force for play. 

What this book presents, is slightly different. It states: 

> “Historically, a dungeon consisted of underground chambers for the confinement of prisoners. In this guidebook, and as a convention used liberally thoughout _AD&D_ game, ‘dungeon’ means any bounded setting within which PCs interact with each other, non-player characters (NPCs), traps, puzzles, monsters, and/or other challenging situations. Thus, this term applies to everything from subterranean mines and burial chambers to castles, cities, and extraplanar abodes.”

And so we see the “Dungeon” invade just about everything. It becomes this pervasive, almost omni-present space. While we did watch dungeons in games like Dragon Warrior, Final Fantasy, Wizardry, and the Gold Box games that used D&D as a set of mechanics, the key to almost all of these games was to enter a (sometimes) vast world filled with excitement and danger. Gone was the DUNGEON as the core, in was the world building with Dungeons anywhere.

Dragon Warrior showed up in 1989 as part of Japan’s entry into what RPGs were meant to be. This accessible game removed all of the hardships, all of the complexity of strictly dungeon-based design and moved them into games where you could just spend hours wandering around by yourself. Through Japan, we see the dungeon slowly give way to the world the dungeon was placed in.

It is important here to note that most of these video games did something to what players would consider to be the bread and butter of RPGs, they made them accessible and easier to understand. Their worlds were immersive and sometimes contained little hidden secrets that you may or may not ever find. Japan’s entry into the space of RPGs coincided with TSR’s creation of game worlds that were perpetual, but via boxed sets, splat books, novels, and comic books. 

It is interesting to see this build up because of another one of my favorite apocryphal tales about the creation of D&D. It goes a little like this: 

1. Dave Wesley had left to college and Dave Arneson had taken up the mantle of Braunstein and was running games for an ever increasing set of players.
2. Dave Arneson was trying to get the players to engage with each other and to explore the town, the characters themselves.
3. However, the players didn’t want to explore the town, they wanted to go into the nearby caves, a Dungeon of sorts. 
4. No matter what Dave did to stop them, it didn’t work. 
5. And so the Dungeon became the thing folks went to for treasure, experience, and hijinks.
6. The Dungeon became the thing.

While again, we aren’t too sure that this is absolutely correct, this is also the thing that we tend to see the most in a game called **_Dungeons_** and Dragons. What Gary Gygax put together after he began moves to commercialize this work, was essentially a game wherein players would construct giant groups of characters and followers, and [follow a map from the Avalon Hill game Outdoor Survival](https://www.dropbox.com/s/62s0w4wsgoxn610/OD%26D%20Setting.pdf?dl=0).

If we look at this map, the first map many would use as the first map for their first D&D campaigns while D&D was still new, it’s important to remember that the Internet didn’t exist so it was often difficult for communities to find each other. Once the Internet became normal, ttrpgs would never be the same. 

What matters here is that we see a slow build up of the central nature of Dungeons and then an attempt to split Dungeons from the worlds the Dungeons existed in. This ocurred between the years of 1974 and 1998. 24 years of development fostered an ever-broadening pipeline of products that would introduce all manner of things for players to engage with.

Since that time, the concept has gained even more prominence. Over the past few years, i’ve been amassing as many different kinds of RPGs as possoible. While D&D is having a heyday (again), we can also see the OSR, particularly Dungeon Crawl Classics having somewhat of a Golden Age. We can see games like Old School Classics, Mothership, Mork Borg, and all manner of game present re-interpretations of these concepts from previous versions of D&D. Along the way, we can _also_ see games like Torchbearer, Honey Heist, and other games on itchio really begin to destabilize what a tabletop RPG is meant to be. Let’s take a brief tour of how they approach the _DUNGEON_ of _Dungeons and Dragons_. 

### Descriptions of Dungeons

What is essentially the default excursion into adventuring, some dude’s obscene basement that is filled with giant rats or something. For example, i picked up a random game called Advanced Dungeon Goons and it has this at the back of the instruction manual:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*OruP_kV-K0JUvGN0bhA7bw.jpeg)

You see this adventure repeated so often, it’s sometimes difficult to remember what game you’re playing as you run through yet another set of rooms attached to some dude’s cellar. 

Death Came Calling approaches Dungeons in a Western. Not a mine, but an abandoned town: 

> You’ve spent weeks on the trail, pining for a soft bed and a warm meal. You’ve lived off of stale jerky, camp break, and hope; now you’re out of all 3. Thankfully, you’ve met a companion on the trail: a man in a linen suit making for the City who has introduced himself as Jasper Rollins. he talks fast, spinning yarns of a former life of glory. A mining town — of which he was the foreman — suffered a few “terrible accidents” which led to the town being abdoned. He claims there’s money to be had there, though he “hasn’t the stomach for such a daring escapade.” As the sun peaks over the hills you find yourselfves alone; the man is nowhere to be seen. his meager stash he left behyind, including a cruyde map showing the path he walked to get here.

Death Came Calling is using the dungeon hook, that space of danger, that will force the players to go and put themselves in danger. 

A game after my heart, Chalice, isn’t really an RPG but a journaling game wherein you make a character and write their journal. While somewhat different, it too is not too far off of the dungeon where the hook becomes, “During the game, you will tell the story of your Knight’s physical and spiritual descent as they quest for, and ultimately fail to find, the Grail. Your Knight’s quest is doomed. Their chivalric virtues will be surely undone by their fatal flaws and moral shortcomings.”

This game also provides a hook of a similar kind: you are trying to find something that matters and along the way, you change. It’s a lot like Gandalf talking to Bilbo about his adventure.

At the end of the day, players in ttrpgs need something to do and that initial design space of playing officers without troops in a wargame was something of a miracle of design. It worked! Only, it needed a hook of some kind. A journey or something that changes.

### So Who Cares?

Across generations, we can see what designers were doing with RPGs through the potential third space of “Dungeons.” These holes in the ground filled with treasure and danger have opened up into towns, ruins, the mind, and even our hometowns. Along the way, we saw fully realized worlds manifest with Dungeons in them and with the help of the Japanese, we saw a few things appear that I haven’t really touched on like the loss of the caller, the loss of the mapper, and the loss of followers. Through this, we see fully fledged worlds with nearly superhero like characters taking on all manner of weird and wild creatures. 

And yet, this is a structure that is constant. It is as though this is the _only_ thing one can do. To make games then, especially for the ttrpg space, is to play with this formula.
