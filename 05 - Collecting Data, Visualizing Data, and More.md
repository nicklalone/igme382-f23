# <a id = "outline"></a>Outline
Over the past few weeks, we've been sort of skirting in and around GIS, mapping technologies, and really the entirety of the course as I do all of the work I wasn't allowed to do in preparation for the course. This week marks the start of 2 things: 
1. Getting this course to where it needs to be. 
2. Getting y'all into geospatial technologies. 
So what does that mean?
Well, first, we're going to have what should be a heavy week in comparison to this course thus far. Second, this week is what this course will feel like moving forward. 

The goals of this week are relatively simple: 
1. Learn what the variety of specific applications GIS can be used for.
2. How to get that data that GIS uses...
3. Find out how to use the layout tools of ArcGIS Pro to build maps than can be exported from ArcGIS Pro.
4. Show me you can apply cartographic concepts such as visual variables and statistical display strategies to map production.

# <a id="day1"></a>Tuesday - What Kinds of Data, How do We Get it? How do we apply it?
Today, we're just going to go through some background terms and ideas. To wit, the terms we're worried about are these: 
1. Shapefiles: 

spatial datasets
predate geodatabse,
still widely used,
only vector data, no curves
different pieces

2 GB Limit
 * Shapefiles
	* filename.shp - containing the coordinates
	* filename.dbf - containing the attributes
	* filename.shx - containing linkages, other info
	* filename.prj - optional, containing projection information
	* filename.sbn - an optional indexing file 
  
3. Geodatabases:
tables, shapefiles, rasters, annotation
true curves
2 terabyte limit per feature class
Enterprise geodatabases have no limits
Must be created in ArcGIS

4. Feature Classes / Databases:

6. Reference Map:
7. Thematic Map:
8. Map Design: 

### <a id="feature"></a>Feature Classes

### <a id="ref"></a>Reference Map

### <a id="theme"></a>Thematic Map

### <a id="mapd"></a>Map Design

Gestalt Theory, it's back...or it's new!

# <a id="day2"></a>Thursday - Getting to know geospatial data queries
### <a id="ass3"></a>Assignment 3:
3 Tasks: 
1. Task 1 – Find and discuss a GIS case study.
2. Task 2 – Explore an emerging topic in GIS.
3. Task 3 – Build a Thematic Map

So let's go through some stuff. 
### <a id="cs"></a>Case Studies!
### <a id="et"></a>Emerging Topics!
### <a id="tm"></a>Thematic Maps!

### <a id="others"></a>How to do all that
Open up GIS, let's see what's inside...
