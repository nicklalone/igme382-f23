# <a id="day1"></a>Tuesday - Hi, how are you?

In class, we went briefly over StoryMaps, how to access them, and how they work. I also asked you to go through this tutorial: https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/cea22a609a1d4cccb8d54c650b595bc4

And then you were asked to do an assignment.

This assignment will see you using StoryMaps. I went over in class how to access StoryMaps so that shouldn't be a problem. What I want is the following: 

Select a Prompt (just 1)

1. **Prompt 1:** If you travelled around the world, what are the 10 or more places you'd stop along the way?
2. **Prompt 2:** Tell us, Show us, and locate a trip you went on recently. 

Once you have selected the prompt, i'll be treating this like a checklist (10 points each): 

1. At least 10 locations (on a map of some kind) with images that either you own, or are creative commons.
2. A timeline with pictures of said highlights.
3. At least 3 text blocks.
4. What your favorite part of the trip was. 
5. What you learned from the trip and why.
6. Where you will go next and why.

Your grade will also consist of 20 points devoted to cohesion, grammar/syntax, and if your images are yours or are creative commons / open.
